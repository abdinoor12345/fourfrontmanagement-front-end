# Fourfront Management - Frontend Assessment

This repository contains my submission for the Frontend Developer assessment. The project is a responsive web page built to match a specific investment platform design, focusing on clean UI, Bootstrap integration, and interactive elements.

## 🚀 Features
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for mobile (9:41 view), tablet, and desktop using the Bootstrap grid system.
- **Dynamic Membership Sections:** Implemented JavaScript to allow users to toggle (reveal/hide) descriptions for the **Foundation** and **Economy** memberships.
- **User Profile Cards:** Custom-styled cards for members including Michael, Benard, and **Caroline Ukhol** (using a specific Teal theme).
- **Modern UI:** High-contrast typography and rounded card designs to match the provided brief.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for better accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Custom styling for specific branding, including the Teal background (`#008080`) for the Caroline card.
- **Bootstrap 5:** Utilized for rapid layout development, buttons, and responsive utilities.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the click events for membership description toggles.
